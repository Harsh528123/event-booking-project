# event-booking-project


## Description
This project allows someone to sign up as a user and login as an authorized user who can create events, 
view other people's events. An authorized user can also book events, view bookings and remove bookings.
It is a very simple app that taught me GraphQL fairly well.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack used in this project was the MERN stack -> Mongo, Express, React and Node JS. For me, the
implementation of MongoDB was new as well as the GraphQL API based approach I implemented for this project.
I used Apollo Server to create GraphQL apis in the backend and used Apollo Client to generate the queries and mutations 
from the frontend. They served a lot of other purposes such as network handling, error handling as well as authentication and authorization. 

## How to
I am currently learning how to deploy it. In the mean time, I have sent some screenshots on how it looks.
